## Development
- Server runs on port 5000
- Run with `npm run dev`
- Guest mode enabled for non-Pi Browser environments

## Deployment
- Static deployment with build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Compatible with Vercel

## Pi Browser Integration
- The app detects Pi Browser via user agent
- Falls back to Guest mode in regular browsers
- SDK initialization has 5-second timeout fallback
- **Pi Login Button**: Gold-themed login button appears for guest users
- **Authentication Flow**: Uses Pi SDK v2.0 with scopes for username, payments, wallet_address
- **piSdk.ts Service**: Provides loginWithPi(), authenticateUser(), verifyUserOnServer() functions
- **TypeScript Types**: PiUser interface for type-safe user handling

## Design System
- **Theme**: Dark futuristic dashboard with glassmorphism
- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary BG: #0A0B0F to #0F1117
  - Card BG: rgba(30, 33, 40, 0.6) with blur
  - Accent Cyan: #00D9FF
  - Accent Purple: #8B5CF6
  - Text Primary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)
  - Text Secondary: rgba(160, 164, 184, 0.8)
- **Effects**: Neon glow, glassmorphism blur, gradient borders, grid pattern background

## Points System Architecture
- **userPoints state**: { total, checkIn, transactions, activity, streak }
- **Point types**: 'checkin' (3 pts) and 'ad' (5 pts bonus)
- **Storage**: localStorage key 'userPointsState' for persistence
- **Legacy migration**: Converts 'dailyCheckInState' to new format (checkIn/activity split)
- **Level calculation**: atomicResult.adjustedScore + earnedPoints (no double-counting)
- **Backend score cap**: 10,000 points for level thresholds (displayScore unlimited)
